# Space Debris Management System

## Executive Summary

This project addresses the critical issue of space debris management, focusing on the more than 20,000 objects in orbit around Earth, which pose significant collision risks to satellites and spacecraft. We developed an advanced data management system capable of tracking and predictive analysis of debris movement to preemptively avoid collisions.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Database**: Utilizes a sophisticated database designed for efficient information storage and retrieval, merging traditional database technologies with cutting-edge innovations for real-time data updates and rapid access.
- **Debris Trajectory Prediction**: Incorporates a comprehensive space debris database to improve prediction of debris trajectory.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Features an interface to aid mission planners and space agencies in making informed decisions.

## Technologies Used

- EER and UML Models
- Database Management Systems - SQL (MySQL Workbench), NoSQL (MongoDB)
- Real-Time Data Processing Technologies

## Implementation

The project was implemented by constructing suitable EER and UML models to design an efficient and reliable database system. This system is not only capable of handling large volumes of data but also ensures rapid access and real-time updates, crucial for the dynamic environment of space.

## Contribution

This project contributes significantly to space safety by providing a tool for space agencies and mission planners to make data-driven decisions, reducing the risk of collisions in space.
